# 🎬 NetMix – Java Video Streaming Platform

**NetMix** is a desktop-based video streaming application developed in **Java**, featuring a smooth GUI built with **Swing** and **JavaFX**.  
In addition to media playback, the app showcases three core **Design Patterns**: **State**, **Decorator**, and **Singleton** — making it both a functional media app and a software architecture showcase.

---

## 📌 Description

NetMix allows users to browse and stream videos locally in a clean, desktop environment. It uses **JavaFX** for media playback and **Swing** for user interface elements.

The app also demonstrates real-world usage of:
- 🎭 **State Pattern** for player states (Playing, Paused, Stopped)
- 🎁 **Decorator Pattern** for adding premium features like HD toggle, subtitles, etc.
- 👑 **Singleton Pattern** for global media player control
